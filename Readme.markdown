# CSS-Only Lightbox-style close buttons

I was rolling my own lightbox JavaScript and needed a close button.
I realized that I didnâ€™t really need an image as I began replacing
the one I had temporarily "borrowed" from a Google Image search 
(I'm a professional, I couldn't leave it like that!).

### Known Issues

The shadow size and offset does not vary with each button size.
This is due to a [bug in Less][known issue]. Manually correcting this is straightforward.
